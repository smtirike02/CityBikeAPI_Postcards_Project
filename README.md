# Big Data - CityBikeAPI

For this project, I will be exploring the connection between pedestrianisation and city bike usage through postcards. Pedestrianisation is an area that is created for walking use.For the final outcome ,I will create hand-drawn postcards showing visualisations from each city with the most bike usage. To grab data, I will be using citybike API which has infomation on bike sharing stations all over the world.

The idea of using postcards stuck with me because people use postcards to share experiences and information by posting them. Biking allows you to experience the world around you physically. My idea for city bikes and postcards on the use of movement is to connect with their surroundings and build an appreciation of the world around them. Postcards enable the movement of personal information without relying on technology.

My postcards display information such as the location, slots, date of the station updated ,bikes available, and the number of stations. The postcards can give you an idea of how often bikes are used. One of my challenges was creating data visualisation on the data I scraped. I've solved this by planning what distinctive keys I would have for each data. To improve the project further, I would like to look at more data at a larger scale, e.g. continent and country, to see if the data is more accurate.
